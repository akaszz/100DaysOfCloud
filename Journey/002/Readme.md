# Pros and Cons of Cloud Computing Platforms to Know Before You Finalize

With the increasing demand for cloud computing platforms in the market, large players are marking their space to giving tough competition to each other. Due to the constant evolution of technology, market and customer requirements, the competition of leadership is also fiercely increasing. There are many cloud computing players in the market who trying to make their own space in the industry. Let’s check out the cloud computing players in the industry:

Out of the above 5 players, clearly there are three major cloud computing platform providers namely:
1. Amazon Web Services (AWS)
2. Microsoft Azure
3. Google Cloud Platform (GCW)

# 1. Major Market Share
If you are planning to launch Platform as a Service (PaaS) or Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) then AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCW) is more ideal choice. All three of the cloud computing vendors have their own strength and weaknesses depending on the customer requirements and network scenarios. Below we have evaluated each and every platform based on their positives and negatives so that enterprise customers planning to build their infrastructure on cloud can make their right choice.


Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform can be considered as the pioneer in the cloud platform because it has launched so many cloud solutions and other players are following the path with certain innovation. As per the Synergy Group report of 2018, AWS has the major market share over other players holding 51% market.


Whereas, the Microsoft Azure is a common choice for enterprise looking for SaaS platform. And GCW is a strong player gaining popularity rapidly in the market and they are utilizing the major market penetration through high discounts.



# 2. Strength Analysis of Cloud Computing Vendors — AWS Vs Azure Vs GCW


### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Amazon has invested a lot in the research and development to launch vast set of tools which is constantly increasing. Having a strong technically strong platform, it has become a common choice for most companies, developers and service providers. But because of the confusing pricing structure and major focus over the public cloud infrastructure rather than Private or Hybrid cloud, AWS lacks the interoperability comparatively.


### Microsoft Azure


One of the tough competitors of AWS and exceptionally innovated platform for enterprise grade cloud platform which has the capability to offer same level of exception results as AWS. If you are an enterprise and if you are using Windows servers for managing infrastructure then you will find Azure more compatible to access and migrate. The strength of Azure is it can seamlessly interoperate with your data centers offering a compatible haven for hybrid cloud.


### GCW Platform


A strong competitor in the market with strong muscle power, Google is offering disrupting market competition to the players with its core focus on the enterprise grade solution. With so many popular products up and running in the market, the trust level of GCW is also higher in the market among enterprise customers. Because of its profound knowledge and expertise in AI, Deep Learning, Machine Learning and Data Analytics, market is anticipating cloud combined hybrid solution from Google.


# 3. Cloud Computing Platform Adoption Rate


As per the recent report from RightScale, the public cloud adoption is constantly increasing and the enterprises are leveraging the services beyond just computing. Most of the companies are using the cloud platform for storage, data analytics, network services, integrations and extended services. Among all the major services, DBaaS, Data Warehouse and Push notification services has gained more popularity in 2019.


# 4. Pros and Cons of Cloud Computing Platform


## Amazon Web Services (AWS) Advantages and Disadvantages


The major strength of the AWS platform is the dominance over the public cloud platform gained in past few years. Within a span of a decade, AWS has become the market leader for in Magic Quadrant of IaaS platform, as per Gartner. The growing demand and ability to cater the current and future scope of requirements from the customers for advanced tools and applications makes AWS undoubtedly powerful platform.


As per the Gartner report, AWS is mature, ready to cater large enterprise requirements, and capable enough to manage and govern large user base as well as resources.

The only weakness of AWS is the pricing which is lowered by AWS frequently, and enterprises are worried about the cost structure and manage the cost of AWS for running high volume of data and workloads. Regardless of the cons of AWS, it is still opted by majority of organizations for wide variety of operations.


## Microsoft Azure Advantages and Disadvantages


Although Microsoft Azure marked its footprint late in the cloud market, it jump started quickly because the comprehensive ground work it had done by following the pioneers. With complete stack and capability to offer Windows Server, Office, SQL server, Sharepoint, etc. on cloud.


The simple strategical success of Azure cloud platform is the existing Windows customer base which they have leveraged to offer a cloud integrated solution. And the current need in the market was a solution that had better interoperability on cloud than other players. Microsoft Azure took the benefit of the need and gained the second popular position in the market. There are several Microsoft enterprise customers who have signed service level contracts.


The only disadvantage that is observed is, as per the Gartner report, some of the enterprise grade applications of Azure seems to have imperfections and less enterprise ready than it is expected. However, like every large solution with minor imperfection, Azure strongly holds the cloud market share.


## Google Cloud Platform Advantages and Disadvantages


The strength of Google is Big Data and Analytics which is the core reason cloud has been given birth. Enterprise customer required the freedom of storing, automating, managing, and analyzing large data and processes. Google developed Kubernetes standard that is now offered by AWS and Azure. The ability to handle large workloads, intelligence of machine learning and speedy response time makes Google a stable and apt platform for cloud.


Google should have been the pioneer in cloud platform, if it had extended its google cloud based products earlier AWS, but it launched its services pretty late. Moreover, the current set of features and services of Google Cloud are also different than its competitor. Google also does not have the amount of data centers available with AWS or Azure.


On the disadvantage side, the GCW is looked as an alternate solution and not as a strategic platform provider as per Gartner. In addition, organizations which are more open source centric or DevOps centric choose GCP.



# 5. Pricing Comparison


Comparing the pricing structure of all the three major players of the cloud vendors which is a tricky area to generalize, however some common points can be listed.


## Pricing of AWS


The pricing structure of AWS is difficult to describe and list but it has its own calculator which requires several variable inputs for actual cost as it uses granular costing method. It is the thing that makes it most confusing pricing structure and difficult to get accurate estimate.


## Pricing of Azure


Microsoft Azure pricing structure is nothing less simple than AWS and it has situational based discounts that adds to the puzzle. Unless you consult with cloud service providers or have considerable experience, it is difficult to understand.


## Pricing of GCP


The major strategy of Google popularity speedily gaining in the market is the pricing strategy which it has well placed to ensure that customers can get what they need at the desired friendly pricing. Flexible contracts and high discounts are the game winning stance of GCP to gain dominance over the cloud market.
